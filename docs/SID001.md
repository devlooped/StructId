## SID001: Struct ids must be partial readonly record structs

Strong-typed identifiers use structs to represent their values with minimal 
memory overhead.

They need to be readonly to guarantee immutability, and partial to allow for 
the automatic generation of implementation details. 

Additionally, using records ensures that the struct correctly implements 
value equality semantics.

### How to fix violations

Change the type declaration to be a `readonly partial record struct` struct. 

A codefix is provided to do this automatically.
