## SID003: Struct Id templates must be file-local partial record structs

Compiled templates annotated with `[TStructId]` must be declared as 
`file partial record struct` structs since they become partial definitions  
for each user-defined struct id. They must be declared as file-local 
to avoid polluting the containing project's visible API surface.

### How to fix violations

Change the type declaration to be a `file partial record struct` struct. 

A codefix is provided to do this automatically.

Example:

```csharp
using System;
using StructId;

[TStructId]
file partial record struct TSelf(Ulid Value)
{
    public static TSelf New() => new(Ulid.NewUlid());
}

// This will be removed when applying the template to each user-defined struct id.
file partial record struct TSelf : INewable<TSelf, Ulid>
{
    public static TSelf New(Ulid value) => throw new NotImplementedException();
}
```
