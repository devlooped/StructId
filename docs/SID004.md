## SID004: Struct Id template constructor must provide a single Value parameter

Custom template constructor must have a single Value parameter, if present. 
This allows using the `Value` property in the implementation of the templated 
code, in a manner that meshes well with the generated code for the struct id.

### How to fix violations

Make sure the primary constructor has a single parameter named `Value`, or 
remove it entirely if not used.
